## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Background
I decided to design my slider with Vanilla JS instead of using a framework. It was actually pretty easy to code the JavaScript for the manual slideshow. However, positioning the slide controller button was a bit challenging. I focused more on accessibility with this project. Users can advance the slideshow using the left and right arrow keyboard keys in addition to using the mouse/track pad.
