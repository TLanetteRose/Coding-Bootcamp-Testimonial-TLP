## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Background
I decided to design my slider with Vanilla JS instead of using a framework. It was actually pretty easy to code the JavaScript for the manual slide. Positioning the slide controllers was a bit challenging.
